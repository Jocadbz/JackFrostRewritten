# JackFrostRewritten

This is an experimental rewrite of the JackFrost project, which is a Discord bot that provides various features for server management and user interaction in C#.

Why? Because it seems fun. Plus, most languages really suck at doing this kind of thing, and C# seems better at it than most, except Python of course.
